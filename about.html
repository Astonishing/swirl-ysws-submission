    <h1>About Spinning Objects</h1>
    <p>
      The orbital flights of men in space and their experimental investigations
      manifested the phenomenon of the rotational and cyclic inversions of the
      spinning objects. This phenomenon under the condition of the free flight
      of the spinning object shocked physicists because, at first sight, this
      effect contradicted the principles of classical mechanics [1-4]. The
      physicists and mathematicians of the entire world study this unusual
      effect [5-8]. They developed several approximated theories and numerical
      models, referred to the tennis racket theorem that did not bring the
      clarity and physical interpretation of the cyclic inversion of the
      spinning objects under the condition of the orbital flight. [9-11]. The
      detailed analysis of the spinning object cyclic inversions and its motions
      in space has shown a manifestation of the known gyroscopic effects at the
      process of its free flight. The physical principles of the gyroscope
      theory and classical mechanics [12-18] describe such motions of the
      spinning objects in space. The action of the inertial torque generated by
      the rotating mass of the spinning object under condition of the circular
      free flight and the weightless are manifested its gyroscopic effect of the
      cyclic inversion.
