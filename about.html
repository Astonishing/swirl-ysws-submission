    <h1>About Spinning Objects</h1>
    <p>
      Spinning objects are all around us, and they play a much bigger role in
      daily life than we usually notice. Whenever something rotates around a
      central line or pivot, it is said to be in rotational motion. The Earth
      spinning on its axis, a fan rotating above your head, and a bicycle wheel
      turning on the road are all examples of the same fundamental idea. Objects
      spin because a force applied away from their center creates a twisting
      effect called torque. This torque causes the object to start rotating, and
      once it begins spinning, it tends to keep rotating unless another force
      slows it down. This behavior comes from rotational inertia, which is
      similar to how objects in straight-line motion resist changes in their
      movement. The speed at which something spins is known as its angular
      velocity, and it depends on how mass is distributed in the object. For
      example, a figure skater spins faster when they pull their arms inward
      because bringing mass closer to the center reduces rotational inertia.
      Many familiar machines—from car engines and washing machines to amusement
      park rides and even the tiny gyroscopes inside smartphones—use these same
      principles. Rotational motion also explains many natural phenomena, like
      why Earth has day and night or why hurricanes rotate. Whether it’s a
      child’s spinning top or a spacecraft using gyroscopes for balance,
      spinning objects reveal the fascinating physics that keeps both everyday
      life and advanced technology running smoothly.
